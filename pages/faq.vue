      Brialle is a tactile typographic representation of the latin writting system. 
      The Unified English Braille Code (UEB) recognizes two standard "Grades" of braille and a few additional sets for mathematics, coding, and music. 
      The standard grades are built upon repeating cells of up to six raised dots. Each cell is either a glyph or modifier that changes how following cells are read.
      <br><br>
      The beginning of one's braille journey starts at Grade 1, consisting of alphanumerics, punctuation, few common words, and limited modifiers. 
      Grade 2 introduces more of these modifiers in the form of "contractions".

      init. thoughts:
      text-to-speech(TTS) and speech-to-text(STT) 
      not good for math etc.
      not greate for writing privately/descretely.
